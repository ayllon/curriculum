\section{Profile}
I am a Software Engineer with more than ten years of experience in C++.
I started in 2010 with the re-design and implementation in C++03 of one of the LHC Grid storage components,
a design that is still in use today. During my career, I have switched from C++03 to C++11 and finally C++14.
I enjoy the language more with each version, and I look forward to being able to use more recent standards in
my everyday work, although I would be more than happy to be given a chance to work with others.
I take great pride in my job for all the projects I have worked on, technically and otherwise.
I consider it essential to keep in mind the final objectives --- software is the means to an end ---
and always have a respectful attitude towards users, colleagues, and even code!
It is, after all, someone else's work.


\section{Work experience}
\cventry{March 2018 -- Present}{Programmer Analyst}{Department of Astronomy, University of Geneva}{Geneva}{Switzerland}{
As a member of the Swiss Science Data Center inside the Euclid Consortium, I participate in the
development, maintenance, testing, and optimization of the software used to determine the distance
of galaxies --- red-shift --- using photometric measurements.\\
I also work on the astronomical image processing suite \emph{SourceXtractor++}, an utility for detecting and measuring sources --- stars, galaxies --- in astronomical images.\\
The software is written mainly in C++14, with some wrapper code in Python. I am used to
profiling the software to identify performance bottlenecks and excessive memory utilization.\\

\section{Project details}

\cventry{2018-*}{Euclid Photo-Z Pipeline}{}{}{}{
Euclid is a space telescope to improve our understanding of dark energy and dark matter.
An integral part of achieving its objectives is determining billions of galaxies'
red-shift (i.e., distance). The Photo-Z team designs and develops algorithms in C++14 and Python to this end. \\
\textbf{Keywords:} C++14, Python, pybind11, Optimizations, Sanitizers (AddressSanitizer, ThreadSanitizer), Coverity
}

\cventry{2018-*}{SourceXtractor++}{}{}{}{
\href{https://github.com/astrorama/SourceXtractorPlusPlus}{SourceXtractor++}
is a program that extracts a catalog of sources from astronomical images.
It is the successor to the original SExtractor package, completely rewritten in C++, with a
modular code design with support for third-party plug-ins. It adds support to a flexible
model fitting that can be configured in Python. To avoid the performance penalty 
of calling Python from a tight C++ loop, the model is
translated to an expression tree using a small custom library called
\href{https://github.com/astrorama/Alexandria/tree/develop/Pyston}{Pyston}.\\
\textbf{Keywords:} C++14, Python, Optimizations, Sanitizers (AddressSanitizer, ThreadSanitizer), Coverity,
Fedora packaging
}

\cventry{2012-2018}{File Transfer Service}{}{}{}{
The File Transfer Service (FTS) is responsible for the transfer scheduling the
LHC experiments ATLAS, CMS and LHCb.
During my period as a lead, this service moved 15PB of data (23M files) per week.\\
\textbf{Keywords:} C++11, Python, MySQL, Network protocols, Golang, ZeroMQ, STOMP, Kibana, Coverity
}

\cventry{2012-2018}{GFAL2}{}{}{}{
The Grid File Access Library is a C library providing an abstraction layer of
the grid storage system complexity.\\
It is used by FTS3, the experiment frameworks, and directly by end users.\\
\textbf{Keywords:} C, C++11, Python, Network protocols, Coverity
}

\cventry{2010-2012}{Disk Pool Manager}{}{}{}{
The Disk Pool Manager (DPM) is a storage system for grid sites.
It offers a simple way to create a disk-based grid storage element composed by
many disk servers.\\
DPM supports the data and metadata access protocols that are relevant for
file management and access in the Grid environment.\\
It was the most deployed storage solution on the LHC Computing Grid with 141 instances.
\textbf{Keywords:} C, C++03, MySQL, HTTP, WebDAV, Python, Network protocols
}

%\cventry{2010-2012}{SAKET}{\textit{Swiss Army Knife for ETICS Testing}}{}{}{
%SAKET was a tool written in Python that automated the execution of builds,
%deployment and tests in ETICS, a web application to build and test the software
%components within the EMI project.\\
%It was used by the \textit{Data Management Systems} section (\textit{Grid Technology} group)
%for the nightly builds, and also for maintaining an archive of these builds and tests.\\
%\textbf{Keywords:} Python, Continuous Integration, SVN.

\cventry{2009-2010}{Takuan}{}{}{}{
Takuan is an open-source WS-BPEL dynamic invariant generator which can infer
invariants from WS-BPEL process definitions by generalizing from a set of
samples of their data and control flows.\\
As part of my Master Thesis, I improved the support of WS-BPEL characteristics
(as properties); I developed a graphical user interface to facilitate running
the tool; and added the capability to obtain instruction, branch and path coverage
from the execution of a test-suite.\\
